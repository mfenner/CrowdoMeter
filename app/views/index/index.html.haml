    What is CrowdoMeter?
    --------------------

    CrowdoMeter is a web service that displays tweets linking to scientific articles, and adds semantic information to these tweets. These tweets are not retrieved in real-time, but rather a test set generated by <a href="http://www.altmetric.com">altmetric.com</a>. CrowdoMeter uses a subset of the Citation Typing Ontology (<a href="http://purl.org/spar/cito/">CiTO</a>), an ontology for the characterization of citations, both factually and rhetorically. To add this semantic information, CrowdoMeter needs your help.

    If you want to help with CrowdoMeter, please sign in with your Twitter account, and start classifying tweets. CrowdoMeter charts the results of your classifications and also tracks the high scores of the most active users. The easiest way to get started is to use the default search term "I'm feeling lucky" - CrowdoMeter will present you four randomly selected tweets you haven't characterized yet.

    CrowdoMeter is a project by <a href="http://www.altmetric.com">Euan Adie</a> and <a href="http://sciencecard.org">Martin Fenner</a>. Please follow us on Twitter at [@CrowdoMeter](http://twitter.com/crowdometer). The crowdsourcing results will be discussed at the <a href="http://scio12.wikispaces.com/Program+draft">ScienceOnline2012</a> conference January 20, 2012.

    The source code of this project is <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/plos-alt-metrics/tree/crowdometer">available at Github</a>.

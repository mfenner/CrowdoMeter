    What is CrowdoMeter?
    ===================

    CrowdoMeter is a web service that displays tweets linking to scientific articles, and adds semantic information to these tweets. These tweets are not retrieved in real-time, but rather a test set generated by <a href="http://www.altmetric.com">altmetric.com</a>. CrowdoMeter uses a subset of the Citation Typing Ontology (<a href="http://purl.org/spar/cito/">CiTO</a>), an ontology for the characterization of citations, both factually and rhetorically. To add this semantic information, CrowdoMeter needs your help.

    If you want to help with CrowdoMeter, please sign in with your Twitter account, and start rating articles. CrowdoMeter charts the results of your ratings and also tracks the high scores of the most active users. 

    CrowdoMeter is a project by <a href="http://www.altmetric.com">Euan Adie</a> and <a href="http://sciencecard.org">Martin Fenner</a>. The crowdsourcing results will be discussed at the <a href="http://scio12.wikispaces.com/Program+draft">ScienceOnline2012</a> conference January 20th, 2012.

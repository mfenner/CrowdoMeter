Welcome to CrowdoMeter
----------------------

CrowdoMeter is a web service that displays tweets linking to scientific articles, and adds semantic information to these tweets. These tweets are not retrieved in real-time, but rather a test set generated by altmetric.com. CrowdoMeter uses a subset of the Citation Typing Ontology (CiTO), an ontology for the characterization of citations, both factually and rhetorically. CrowdoMeter charts the results of all classifications and also tracks the high scores of the most active users. The classification of tweets was done between December 19, 2011 and January 31, 2012.
